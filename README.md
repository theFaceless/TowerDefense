TowerDefense
============

Our first game, a tower defense game

==========



ToDo
========
-Improve GUI: Make the GUI look nice, and add some place on the gui for buttons and text and shizzles.

-Money system: Money needed to buy buildings
		Money can be earned through killing enemies or special buildings (like a generator)

-powersystem: area wich includes power for towers. Towers can be build in these areas. At the beginnings these areas
              will be spawn around the castles and can be enlarged with special towers.

-Delete/Sell option: an option to sell a builing.

-generator: building that gives you extra money over time.

-upgrades(towers,enemies, castles)
